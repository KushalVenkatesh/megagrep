Megagrep
========

> Or how to begin a code review

**Megagrep helps beginning a code review by looking at keywords in the code using
"grep", but this is not static analysis tool**. 

Megagrep and its keyword sets are built to search for places in the code that
require to be investigated manually. It will give you **locations** (where to
find vulnerabilities), not vulnerabilities directly.

If you want a grep-based static analysis tool (for vulnerability research), you
can check [Graudit](https://github.com/wireghoul/graudit).
